Method for suppressing cortical signals while preserving subcortical signals in MEG and EEG.

Based on the paper Samuelsson J, Khan S, Sundaram P, Peled N, Hamalainen M (2018) Cortical Signal Suppression (CSS) for detection of subcortical activity using MEG and EEG. Please reference this paper when using CSS. 

CSS.py contains the CSS algorithm. runme.py generates Figures 1,3,4,5 in the paper mentioned above. It uses only data from the MNE-python 'sample' folder and labels provided locally in the repository.
